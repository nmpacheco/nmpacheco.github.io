### This is where I'll briefly describe the things a lot of people allowed me to work in since 1993.    
Going backwards...  

I've been helping building software to support SRE's way of doing things and also pretending to be one.  
Still dealing with good old ITIL ;)  
Linux, docker, swarm, python, go, elasticsearch, kibana, kafka, hashicorp vault, nexus, ansible, AWX, jenkins, postgres, mysql, javascript, machine learning and others are all part of our toolbox.  
Those, Oracle, Solaris, AIX, SAP, a nice salad of web and application servers, other fine combination of cloud providers, among others, are the technologies supported.  

AI enthusiast starting with ml and deep learning.  
  
I helped architecting and building nice datacenter services and architectures related offers and proposals to Clients and prospects.  
I helped managing some datacenter related projects like disaster recovery implementations, database consolidations, datacenter migrations and so on.  
I joined smart people to build service level indicators, objectives and agreements and decide the most appropriate combination that would match the given requirements.  
  
Some nice people allowed themselves to be led by me, either directly or indirectly. We were accountable for a bunch of AIX, Solaris, Windows, Linux, HP-UX, ESX, firewalls, load balancers, switches, routers, SAN switches, TSM Servers, Avamar boxes, Datadomains, Symmetrix, VMAX, Clariions, VNX, HDS, HP "stuff", datacenter rooms and a lot more than one (or two) can remember.  
We were doing changes, incidents, problems, projects and go figure... planning all of that!  

Before that, had to learn how to do it doing it, again with a bunch of bright people!  
We even did mpp with the largest european IBM SP2! At the time, of course. ;)  

In the early days I worked with people COBOLing and MANTISing business software for IBM mainframes. We also did a lot of $$$ debugging!
Helped managing CICS, VSAM, DB2 and other mainframe stuff.  
By that time, the internet, related services and other open technologies landed in large companies, so...
